## 🔗 Video Request Links

This enpoint allows you to request a unique video request link and drop it anywhere in your application or internal process.

## 🎥 Videos

This enpoint allows you to display a recorded video or delete videos (by their ID).


## 📢 Public Links

If you don't want to generate unique links for each recording, you can use public links.

They look something like that: https://app.videosupport.io/pl/eULM/videosupport.io

You can easily add URL parameters (such as `?conversation_id=id123`) to it. If you setup a webhook trigger in the settings (see next section below), those parameters will be added as `external_parameters` to the webhook notification triggerred whenever a video has been recorded with that link.
It allows you to add any custom context to those links and display the videos recorded anywhere relevant in your interface.


## 🪝 Webhooks

Each API key can be linked to a specific webhook. As soon as a video has been recorded either:
- by generating a video request link with that API key (itself linked to a webhook)
- from a public link directly attached to that webhook

a webhook notification will be triggered containing:
- the link to the video
- the URL to the video file (if you need to download it)
- any external parameters of your choice (conversation ID, user ID, user e-mail, etc.)
