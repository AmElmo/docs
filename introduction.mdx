## 👋 Introduction

This API allows you to:

🔗 generate video request links to send to any user in your application  

📽️ offer your users a video recording interface directly in their browser (mobile or desktop)  

🏗️ store those videos on URLs that don't require an account to be accessed  

💽 pass any custom data (through URL parameters) to those videos in order to leverage that context later in your application  

🪝 receive webhook notifications when videos have been recorded in order to push videos anywhere in your application
