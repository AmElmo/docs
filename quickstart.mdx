## Authenticating requests

All requests to the REST API must be authenticated by passing your secret token in the headers of the requests as follows:

`headers["Access-Token"] = "your_secret_token"`


The base URL of the API is the following:

`https://app.videosupport.io/api/:api_version`

Where the api_version is the version linked to your credential set (currently v1)

üí° Only https requests are accepted.
